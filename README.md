# ghcr-build-push

Reusable GitHub Actions workflow to **build a container image** using [Buildah](https://github.com/containers/buildah) and **push it to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)**.  

- Builds your image from `./Containerfile`
- Tags it as `:latest`
- Pushes only when running on the **default branch**
- Cleans up untagged images from GHCR automatically
